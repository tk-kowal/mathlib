# Tom's Math Lib

My header-only math library. This is intended as a learning project. This is also a chance to learn modern C++ and potentially further down the line things like SIMD.

# Build & Install

cmake install

# Inspiration

Some of these implementations are loosely inspired by [OpenGL Mathematics](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
